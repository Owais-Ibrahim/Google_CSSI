# Google_CSSI
Google Computer Science Summer Institute (CSSI) is a four-week summer program hosted by Google engineers to immerse students within the fields of computer science. I participated by taking the CS 101 curriculum in which we took a focus on Javascript and its p5 library. Each day we worked to make an interactive project/game/application where we practiced our skills in JS, the p5 library, data structures, loops, objects, class structures, and many other programming concepts.
